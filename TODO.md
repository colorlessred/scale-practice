TODO backlog

* implement automatic speed-up
* implement ability to use different patterns (not just one up and one down)
    * can pattern move across NoteSets?
* implement NoteSetProvider instances for
    * fixed sequence
* make UI pretty
* display notes in proper notation
* possibility to have scales without the root note
* add possibility to define custom scale (using steps? note?)
* ability to display the next notes that will be played (e.g. in the NoteSet).
    * this means there is some queue pre-reading the notes, but this breaks the current design
